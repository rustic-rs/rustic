# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

0.Y.Z versions are only supported for the last minor (`Y`) version.

When `rustic` reaches 1.0.0, we will reiterate on this security policy.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Responsible disclosure of security issues is highly appreciated.

**Please do not report or discuss security vulnerabilities through public GitHub
issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Issues can be reported privately to the maintainers by opening a
[Security vulnerability report](https://github.com/rustic-rs/rustic/security/advisories/new).

### Preferences

- Please provide detailed reports with reproducible steps and a clearly defined
  impact.
- Include the version number of the vulnerable package in your report.
- Fixes are most welcome. A private PR can be created from the security report
  to work on and discuss the patch.
