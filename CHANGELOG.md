## [0.6.0] - 2023-10-23

### Breaking Changes

- We refactored to
  [`rustic_core`](https://www.github.com/rustic-rs/rustic_core). This means that
  most of the underlying logic can now be used as a library. The CLI is now a
  thin wrapper around the library. This also means that the CLI is now much more
  customizable. Please check out the
  [documentation](https://rustic.cli.rs/docs/getting_started.html) for more
  information.

### Bug Fixes

- Retrying backend access didn't work for long operations. This has been fixed
  (and retries are now customizable)
- Prune did abort when no time was set for a pack-do-delete. This case is now
  handled correctly.
- The zstd compression library led to data corruption in very unlikely cases.
  This has been fixed by a dependency update.
- The glob option did only work with absolute files. This has been fixed.
- Non-unicode link targets are now correctly handled on Unix (after this has
  been added to the restic repo format).
- The `--dry-run` option now works as expected in the `init` command.

### Features

- New global configuration paths are available, located at `/etc/rustic/*.toml`
  or `%PROGRAMDATA%/rustic/config/*.toml`, depending on your platform.
- REST backend: Now allows to use custom TLS root certificates.
- Environment variables for programs called by rustic can now be set in the
  config files.
- Creation of new keys now enforces confirmation of entered key. This helps to
  prevent mistype of passwords during the initial entry
- Wait for password-command to successfully exit, allowing to input something
  into the command, and read password from stdout.
- backup: New option --init to initialize repository if it doesn't exist yet.
- backup: New option `no-require-git` - if enabled, a git repository is not
  required to apply `git-ignore` rule.
- restore: The restore algorithm has been improved and should now be faster for
  remote repositories.
- restore: Files are now allocated just before being first processed. This
  allows easier resumed restores.
- repoinfo: Added new options --json, --only-files, --only-index.
- check: Add check if time is set for packs-to-delete.
- ls: Options --long (-l) and --summary (-s) have been added.
- forget: Option --json has been added.

## [0.5.4] - 2023-06-05

### Bug Fixes

- backup crashed when there was a non-unicode link target. The crash has been
  fixed. However, non-unicode link targets are still unsupported.
- Extended attributes which were saved with value null couldn't be handled. This
  has been fixed.
- prune: --max-repack didn't work with a given percentage of repo size. This has
  been fixed.

### Features

- copy: Added --init option to initialize uninitialized target repos
- dependencies have been updated

### Miscellaneous Tasks

- Bump serde_with from 2.3.2 to 2.3.3

## [0.5.3] - 2023-04-25

### Breaking Changes

### Bug Fixes

- The [[backup.sources]] section in the config file was ignored 0.5.2. This has
  been fixed.

### Features

- The show-config command has been added.

### Backup

- Fix omitting sources config from the config file

## [0.5.2] - 2023-04-24

### Breaking Changes

- The CLI option `--config-profile` was renamed into `--use-profile` (same
  shortcut `-P`).

### Bug Fixes

- restore: Warm-up options given by the command line didn't work. This has been
  fixed.
- backup: showed 1 dir as changed when backing up without parent. This has been
  fixed.
- diff: The options --no-atime and --ignore-devid had no effect and are now
  removed.
- Rustic's check of additional fields in the config file didn't work in edge
  cases. This has been fixed.

### Features

- backup: Backing up (small) files has been speed-optimized and is now much more
  parallelized.
- Config file: New field use-profile under [global] allows to merge options from
  other config profiles
- Option --dry-run is now a global option and can also be defined in the config
  file or via env variable
