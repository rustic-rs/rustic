Changes in version 0.3.1:

Note: Changing the binary name to rustic is a breaking change with respect to the self-update command.
This means rustic 0.3.0 can *NOT* be updated using self-update. Please download the binaries manually instead.

Bugs fixed:
- change escaping of filename to get identical result as restic
- fix performance regression because of filename escaping
- chunker: Fixed chunker such that chunks of MINSIZE are possible.
- prune: Fix option --max-repack; now also works when resizing packs.

New features:
- Changed name of binary from rustic-rs to rustic
- Added config file support (see examples in `config/` dir)
- Added options --password and --password-command (and equivalents as env variables and config file options)
- snapshots: Summarize fully identical snapshots in snapshots command; added option --all.
- snapshots: Grouping by hosts and paths is now the default.
- snapshots: Added --json option
- backup: Allow backing up multiple source paths
- backup: Allow backup from stdin
- backup/parent detection now uses ctime and mtime; new options --ignore-mtime and --ignore-inode
- backup: Added option --exclude-larger-than
- forget: Always remove snapshots when ID is given
- prune: Only resize small packs when target packsize will be reached.
- prune: Added option --no-resize
- chunker: Increase buffer size to speed up chunking
- Added aarch64-apple-darwin as supported platform
- CI: Added rust audit
