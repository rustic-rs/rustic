Changes in version 0.4.4:

Bugs fixed:
- Integrated the cdc crate as it currently doesn't compile with current Rust. This allows to upload rustic to crates.io. 
- restore: Don't abort on errors, but print a warning and continue
- REST backend now ignores extra files in repository, as local backend does.
- init did not work for hot/cold repos. This is fixed.
- A password file without a newline didn't work. This is fixed.

New features:
- diff/restore: Allow to use a single file as target and treat it correctly
- local backend: Added possibility to add hooks. This can be used e.g. to automatically generate .par2 files for your local repo.
- backup: Added option --json
- The chunker implementation has been optimized
- Default grouping now includes grouping by labels
- Added OpenBSD as platform
- Many version updates of dependencies
