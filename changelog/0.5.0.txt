Changes in version 0.5.0:

Breaking changes:
- Repository options in the config file can no longer be given under the `[global]` section. Use `[repository]` instead.
- Backing up multiple sources on the command line now results in one instead of several snapshots.

Bugs fixed:
- `restore` command  did not restore empty files. This is fixed.
- `config` command did save the config file compressed which violates the repo design. This is fixed.
- rustic did panic when files with missing `content` field are stored in a tree. This is fixed.

New features:
- Experimental windows support has been added.
- New option --filter-fn allows to implement your own snapshot filter using the Rhai language.
- New command dump has been added.
- New command merge has been added.
- Support for extended file attributes has been added.
- REST/Rclone backend: Allow to set the request timeout.
- Extra or wrong fields in the config file now lead to rustic complaining and aborting.
- New option --no-progress has been added.
- Option --progress-interval can now also be given as command argument and in the config file.
- backup: Paths are now sanitized from command arguments and config file before matching and applying the configuration.
- restore: Add --no-ownership option
- check --read-data: progress bar now also shows total bytes to check and ETA.
- The archiver implementation has been reworked. This will allow more backup sources in future.
- Updated to Rust 1.68 and many dependency updates
