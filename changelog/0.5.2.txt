Changes in version 0.5.2:

Breaking changes:
- The CLI option `--config-profile` was renamed into `--use-profile` (same shortcut `-P`).

Bugs fixed:
- restore: Warm-up options given by the command line didn't work. This has been fixed.
- backup: showed 1 dir as changed when backing up without parent. This has been fixed.
- diff: The options --no-atime and --ignore-devid had no effect and are now removed.
- Rustic's check of additional fields in the config file didn't work in edge cases. This has been fixed.

New features:
- backup: Backing up (small) files has been speed-optimized and is now much more parallelized.
- Config file: New field use-profile under [global] allows to merge options from other config profiles
- Option --dry-run is now a global option and can also be defined in the config file or via env variable 
- forget: Using "-1" as value for --keep-* options will keep all snapshots of that interval
- prune: Added option --repack-all
- Updated to clap v4
