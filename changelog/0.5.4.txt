Changes in version 0.5.4:

Bugs fixed:
- backup crashed when there was a non-unicode link target. The crash has been fixed. However, non-unicode link targets are still unsupported.
- Extended attributes which were saved with value null couldn't be handled. This has been fixed.
- prune: --max-repack didn't work with a given percentage of repo size. This has been fixed.

New features:
- copy: Added --init option to initialize uninitialized target repos
- dependencies have been updated
