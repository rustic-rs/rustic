Changes in version x.x.x:

Breaking changes:

Bugs fixed:
- prune did abort when no time was set for a pack-do-delete. This case is now handled correctly.
- retrying backend access didn't work for long operations. This has been fixed (and retries are now customizable)
- The zstd compression library led to data corruption in very unlikely cases. This has been fixed by a dependency update.

New features:
- New global configuration paths are available, located at /etc/rustic/*.toml or %PROGRAMDATA%/rustic/config/*.toml, depending on your platform.
- REST backend: Now allows to use custom TLS root certificates.
- restore: The restore algorithm has been improved and should now be faster for remote repositories.
- restore: Files are now allocated just before being first processed. This allows easier resumed restores.
- New option: `no-require-git` for backup - if enabled, a git repository is not required to apply `git-ignore` rule.
- fix: wait for password-command to successfully exit, allowing to input something into the command, and read password from stdout.
- repoinfo: Added new options --json, --only-files, --only-index
- Creation of new keys now enforces confirmation of entered key. This helps to prevent mistype of passwords during the initial entry
- Check: Add check if time is set for packs-to-delete
- ls: Options --long (-l) and --summary (-s) have been added.
