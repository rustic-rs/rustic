# Rustic Configuration Specification

`rustic` is a backup tool that allows users to define their backup options in
profiles using TOML files. A configuration profile consists of various sections
and attributes that control the behavior of `rustic` for different commands and
sources.

This specification covers all the available sections and attributes in the
`rustic` configuration profile file and includes their corresponding environment
variable names. Users can customize their backup behavior by modifying these
attributes according to their needs.

## Merge Precedence

The merge precedence for values is:

    Commandline Arguments >> Environment Variables >> Configuration Profile

Values parsed from the `configuration profile` can be overwritten by
`environment variables`, which can be overwritten by `commandline arguments`
options. Therefore `commandline arguments` have the highest precedence.

**NOTE**: There are the following restrictions:

- You can overwrite values, but for most values, you cannot "unset" them on a
  higher priority level.

- For some integer values, you cannot even overwrite with the value `0`, e.g.
  `keep-weekly = 5` in the `[forget]` section of the config file cannot be
  overwritten by `--keep-weekly 0`.

## Profiles

Configuration files can be placed in the user's local config directory, e.g.
`~/.config/rustic/` or in the global config dir, e.g. `/etc/rustic/`. You can
use different config files, e.g. `myconfig.toml` and use the `-P` option to
specify the profile name, e.g. `rustic -P myconfig`. Examples for different
configuration files can be found here in the [/config/](/config) directory.

## Services

We have collected some examples how to configure `rustic` for various services
in the [services/](/config/services/) subdirectory. Please note that these
examples are not complete and may not work out of the box. They are intended to
give you a starting point for your own configuration.

### Global Options - env variables

All given environment variables are set before processing. This is handy to
configure e.g. the `rclone`-backend or some commands which will be called by
rustic.

**Important**: Please do not forget to include environment variables set in the
config profile as a possible source of errors if you encounter problems. They
could possibly shadow other values that you have already set.

### WebDAV Options

`rustic` supports mounting snapshots via WebDAV. This is useful if you want to
access your snapshots via a file manager.

**Note**: `https://` and Authentication are not supported yet.
