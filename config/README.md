# Rustic Configuration Specification

`rustic` is a backup tool that allows users to define their backup options using
a TOML configuration file. The configuration file consists of various sections
and attributes that control the behavior of `rustic` for different commands and
sources.

This specification covers all the available sections and attributes in the
`rustic` configuration file and includes their corresponding environment
variable names. Users can customize their backup behavior by modifying these
attributes according to their needs.

## Merge Precedence

The merge precedence for values is:

    Commandline Arguments >> Environment Variables >> Configuration File

Values parsed from the `configuration file` can be overwritten by
`environment variables`, which can be overwritten by `commandline arguments`
options. Therefore `commandline arguments` have the highest precedence.

**NOTE**: There are the following restrictions:

- You can overwrite values, but for most values, you cannot "unset" them on a
  higher priority level.

- For some integer values, you cannot even overwrite with the value `0`, e.g.
  `keep-weekly = 5` in the `[forget]` section of the config file cannot be
  overwritten by `--keep-weekly 0`.

## Profiles

Configuration files can be placed in the user's local config directory, e.g.
`~/.config/rustic/` or in the global config dir, e.g. `/etc/rustic/`. You can
use different config files, e.g. `myconfig.toml` and use the `-P` option to
specify the profile name, e.g. `rustic -P myconfig`. Examples for different
configuration files can be found here in the [/config/](/config) directory.
