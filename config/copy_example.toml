# This is an example how to configure the copy command to copy snapshots from one repository to another
# The targets of the copy command cannot be specified on the command line, but must be in a config file like this.
# If the config file is named "copy_example.toml", run "rustic -P copy_example copy" to copy all snapshots.
# See "rustic copy --help" for options how to select or filter snapshots to copy.

# [repository] specified the source repository
[repository]
repository = "/tmp/repo"
password = "test"

# you can specify multiple targets. Note that each target must be configured via a config profile file
[copy]
target = ["full", "rustic"]
