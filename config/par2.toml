# This is an example how to use the post-create-command and post-delete-command hooks to add
# error correction files using par2create to a local repository.
# The commands can use the variable %file, %type and %id which are replaced by the filename, the
# file type and the file id before calling the command.
[repository]
repository = "/tmp/repo"
password = "test"

[repository.options]
# after saving a file in the repo, this command is called
post-create-command = "par2create -qq -n1 -r5 %file"

# after removing a file from the repo, this command is called.
# Note that we want to use a "*" in the rm command, hence we have to call sh to resolve the wildcard!
post-delete-command = "sh -c \"rm -f %file*.par2\""
