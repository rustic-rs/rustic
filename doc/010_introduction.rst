Rustic is a fast and secure backup program. In the following sections, we will
present typical workflows, starting with installing, preparing a new
repository, and making the first backup.

Note that this docu is shamelessly copied from the restic docu and then adapted to rustic
as most workflows work in rustic exactly like restic.
See also the [restic documentation](https://restic.readthedocs.io) for more information
about restic.
