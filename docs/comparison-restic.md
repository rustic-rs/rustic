# Comparison rustic vs. restic

Improvements implemented in rustic:

- Allows using cold storage (e.g. AWS Glacier) repos which are only read in the
  `restore` command + supports warm-up
- All operations are completely lock-free as rustic supports two-phase-pruning
  (prune option `instant-delete` is available)
- Supports configuration in a config file
  ([example config files](https://github.com/rustic-rs/rustic/tree/main/config))
- Huge decrease in memory requirement
- Already faster than restic for most operations (but not yet fully speed
  optimized)
- Cleaner concept of logging output; possibility to write logs to a log file
- `rustic repair` command allows to repair some kinds of broken repositories
- `backup` command can use `.gitignore` files
- `restore` uses existing files; also option `--delete` available
- Snapshots save much more information, available in `snapshots` command
- Integrates the [Rhai](https://rhai.rs/) script language for snapshot filtering
- Allows to save repository options in the repository config file via the
  command `config`
- New command `merge`
- New command `repo-info`
- `check` command checks and uses cache; option `--trust-cache` is available
- Option `prune --fast-repack` for faster repacking
- Syntax `<SNAPSHOT>[:PATH]` is available for many commands

## Missing points

- [ ] tests and benchmarks
- [ ] missing commands: find, mount
