# Requirements

1. **Automated Backup Scheduling**

   - The system should allow for automated backups at specified intervals
     (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

1. **Easy Restoration**

   - Users should be able to quickly and easily restore data from the backups,
     preferably with a one-click solution.

1. **Selective Backup**

   - The solution should allow users to select specific data sets or files for
     backup.

1. **Centralized Management Dashboard**

   - A unified dashboard where users (especially those managing multiple
     systems) can oversee all backups.

1. **User Access Control & Role-based Permissions**

   - Different levels of access and permissions to ensure that data integrity
     and security are maintained.

1. **Large File Handling without Compression Loss**

   - The system should handle the backup of large files while maintaining their
     original quality.

1. **Auto-sync Feature**

   - A feature that automatically syncs and backs up directories or specified
     data.

1. **Guided Backup Process**

   - For users who are not tech-savvy, a step-by-step guide to backing up data.

1. **Efficient Deduplication Process**

   - To ensure storage is used efficiently by avoiding duplicate backups of
     identical files.

1. **Shareable Backup Links**

   - Generation of secure links to backup datasets/files for sharing.

1. **Version Control**

   - The system should keep track of different versions of backed-up files,
     allowing users to revert if needed.

1. **Bulk Backup**

   - Allow users to backup large sets of data or entire directories at once.

1. **Strong Encryption and Data Security**

   - All backed-up data, especially sensitive information, should be encrypted
     and stored securely.

1. **Remote Access Capability**

   - Users should be able to access the backup solution from different locations
     or devices.

1. **Integration with Other Platforms**

   - E.g., Code repositories, blogging platforms, etc.

1. **Rapid Data Recovery**

   - Fast restore features for urgent data recovery needs.

1. **Offline Backup Queuing**

   - Allow backups to be initiated offline and processed once connectivity is
     available.

1. **High-speed Data Uploads**

   - Efficiently handle and quickly upload large files or data sets.

1. **Documentation Clarity**

   - The backup solution library should have clear and comprehensive
     documentation. This will enable developers like Aisha to integrate the
     library seamlessly.

1. **Customization Options**

   - The library should provide a variety of settings and configurations that
     developers can adjust, ensuring it fits various software's unique
     requirements.

1. **Test Environment**

   - The backup solution should offer a sandbox or test mode. This helps
     developers to test the library's functionalities without affecting real
     data.

1. **Active Support Community**

   - An active forum or community where developers can post questions, share
     experiences, and offer solutions. Quick response times are crucial.

1. **Error Handling**

   - The library should be designed with robust error handling and should
     provide descriptive error messages. This aids developers in diagnosing
     integration or functionality issues.

1. **Compatibility**

   - Ensure the core library is compatible with a range of programming languages
     and frameworks to cater to a diverse developer base.

1. **Scalability**

   - As software may grow and handle more data, the backup library should be
     scalable to accommodate increasing data without performance bottlenecks.
